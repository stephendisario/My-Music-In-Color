## 🌟 App Features Overview

### 1. **Rainbow Musaic** - The Landing Page 🌈

After logging into the app, users are greeted with the **Rainbow Musaic**. This is where your top tracks from each color group are compiled into one 8x8 musaic. Below the musaic you will find controls for shuffling the musaic, switching colors, and playlist creation.

### 4. **Playlist Creation** - Listen to Your Musaic 🎶🎧

With the **Playlist Creation** feature, you can save the current Musaic as a custom playlist on Spotify. The playlist's image is a snapshot of the Musaic itself, and the songs in the playlist are the ones in the Musaic.

### 6. **Automatic Image Resizing** 🖼️

**Automatic Image Resizing** allows the Musaic to adapt when there are fewer songs. The default musaic is 8x8 but if a color group has less than 64 songs, it will resize to the next biggest perfect square.

### 7. **Hide Icons** - Clean View of the Musaic 🧹

Sometimes, you may want to just enjoy the **Musaic** without any distractions. The **Hide Icons** feature removes all controls and buttons from the screen, and can be enabled by clicking anywhere on the background of the screen.
