# MyMusicInColor - Explore your colorful musaics 🎶🌈

Welcome to **MyMusicInColor**, an app that groups your top tracks from the past year by color and creates ~musaics~. This preview showcases the core features and visual elements of the app while awaiting Spotify's production approval. Feel free to explore the images and demo video below to get a sense of the app's functionality and design.

> **Note**: Since the app is still in development mode, it is not currently accessible to the public. Please stay tuned for updates!

## 🌟 App Features Overview

### 1. **Rainbow Musaic** - The Landing Page 🌈

After logging into the app, users are greeted with the **Rainbow Musaic** (arguably the best musaic). This is where your top tracks from each color group are compiled into an 8x8 musaic. Below the musaic you will find the **Control Bar** used for shuffling, switching colors, and playlist creation.

### 4. **Playlist Creation** - Listen to Your Musaic 🎶🎧

When you are happy with a Musaic you have created, you can save it as a custom playlist on Spotify. The playlist's image is a snapshot of the Musaic itself.

### 6. **Automatic Image Resizing** 🖼️

**Automatic Image Resizing** allows the Musaic to adapt when there are fewer songs in a color group. The default musaic is 8x8 but if a color group has less than 64 songs, it will resize to the next biggest perfect square.

### 7. **Hide Icons** - Clean View of the Musaic 🧹

Sometimes, you may want to enjoy the **Musaic** without any distractions. The **Hide Icons** feature removes all icons from the screen, and can be enabled by clicking anywhere outside of the musaic and control bar.
